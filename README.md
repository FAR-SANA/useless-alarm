# [WAKEUPWARRIOR] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Hacksy]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Fathima Nehla p s] - [SCMS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY]
- Member 2: [Farsana C A] - [SCMS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY]


### Project Description
[WakeUpWarrior Alarm
WakeUpWarrior is a fun, web-based alarm clock that makes sure you really wake up. Stop the alarm by either:

üëè Clapping 10 times (mic access required)

‚å®Ô∏è Typing random letters shown on-screen

It features a real-time clock, rising-pitch alarm sound, motivational quotes, and automatic light/dark themes. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the Web Audio and Media APIs.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
 [People snooze their alarms without actually waking up.

We‚Äôve all been there: you set an alarm, it goes off, you slap your phone or hit snooze in a half-conscious daze... and suddenly it's 2 hours later. You never actually woke up ‚Äî just reacted.]

#Make your brain work or make noise to prove you're awake.

Clap detection forces you to literally make noise 10 times ‚Äî good luck sleep-clapping.

Typing random letters activates your motor skills and attention ‚Äî you can‚Äôt do it half-asleep.

In short, WakeUpWarrior solves the age-old (and ridiculous) problem of:

"How do I stop my future self from sabotaging my morning?"

With a little tech, a little noise, and a little absurdity.]

## Technical Details

### Project Documentation
For Software:
Clock Logic: Updates every second using setInterval, displays current time.

Alarm Trigger: Compares current time to user-set alarm time.

Stop Methods:

Clap Mode: Uses microphone + Web Audio API to detect loud sounds.

Keyboard Mode: Generates random letters the user must type.

Alarm Sound: Uses Web Audio API oscillator with rising frequency effect.

Themes: Auto toggles light/dark based on time; manual toggle available.
